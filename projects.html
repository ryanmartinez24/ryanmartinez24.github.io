            <p> This app was a group project I completed as part of a class at Penn.
                The app can be used by food truck vendors to setup menus online. Users can then
                order food from the app and pay in app. We implemented this using Java in android studio for the client
                side, and javascript and node.js for the server side. Orders were also stored in a a database we created
                using MongoDB
