                    The website is basically ready to launch. I don't exactly like how it looks so expect a redesign soon!
                    That said, I still have some problems when the website is resized. I'm working on figuring that out,
                    but in the meantime I'm going to put the website up.

                <p>Hello, I am glad to see you have made it to the blog section of my website.
                Right now it's a bit sparse and to be honest I'm not sure how much I'll update this page.
                For now I'll leave you with this list of my 3 favorite snacks:

                    <li>Nerd's Gummy Clusters</li>
                    <li>Ferrero Rocher</li>
